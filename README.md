> **Raising awareness about gender inequality through interactive data visualizations**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is an interactive data visualization dashboard that explores various aspects of **gender inequality** across different domains - from workplace pay gaps to demographic disparities. Built as part of my first-year Computer Science coursework (CM1010 - Introduction to Programming II), this project aims to make gender inequality data accessible and impactful through compelling visual storytelling. Additionally, it includes an analysis of racial diversity in the tech industry to provide broader context on inequality issues.

## 🌟 Key Message

**Gender inequality remains a persistent global challenge.** Through data visualization, we can:

- Make complex statistics more understandable
- Reveal patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed
- Spark conversations about systemic inequalities
- Drive awareness that leads to positive change

_Note: This project primarily focuses on gender inequality, with one additional visualization exploring racial diversity in tech to provide broader context on workplace inequality._

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I developed skills in:

- **Creative Coding** with p5.js for interactive graphics
- **Data Visualization Design** principles and best practices
- **JavaScript Programming** including ES6+ features
- **Web Development** fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Problem-Solving** through iterative design and debugging
- **Social Impact Technology** - using code to address real-world issues

## 🌍 Impact & Reflection

This project reinforced my belief that **technology can be a powerful tool for social change**. By making inequality data more accessible and engaging, we can:

- Educate viewers about persistent inequalities (both gender and racial)
- Encourage data-driven discussions about systemic issues
- Inspire action toward creating more equitable societies

Data tells stories, and these stories matter. Every visualization in this project represents real people and real challenges that deserve our attention and action.
